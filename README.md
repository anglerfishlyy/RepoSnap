# RepoSnap
snapshot of repo

A tiny Node.js CLI + VS Code extension (single-click / context-menu) that copies a clean, AI-friendly snapshot of the repo structure (ASCII tree, Markdown, JSON) to clipboard â€” plus an option to upload the snapshot as a GitHub Gist (so you can paste a short link into ChatGPT / Cursor / Slack). Use the CLI standalone or via the VS Code command.
